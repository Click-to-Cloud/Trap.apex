## {$page.title}

Trap.apex has a dependency on [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex) and [Stream.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/Stream.apex).

First, we will include R.apex.

Include **Func.cls**, **R.cls**, and **RTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and R.apex is ready.

Then, we will include Stream.apex.

Include **Stream.cls**, and **StreamTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and Stream.apex is ready.

Then, we will include Trap.apex.

Include **Trap.cls**, **TrapTest.cls**(optional) and other optional files into your Org, and you are ready to go.
